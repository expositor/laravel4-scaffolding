====================

version 2

Experimental Scaffolding

The intent of this program is for me to learn Laravel in a thorough way. I know there is already a generator out there by Jeffrey Way, and by far that one is better. When I tried it, I quickly realized that I have a lot to learn before I even touch other applications. My philosophy is, if I understand a part of Laravel, I will incorporate it into the generator, otherwise, I will hold back until I learn. 

I do not have a lot of experience coding in PHP, so my coding practices, at least in the generator, is probably not up to par. The codes in the generator itself is a mess in today's standards, because everything is inside one super function. When I compared my code to Way's code, I realized there are a lot of functions and classes that I don't understand. Still yet to learn IOC containers, abstract or interface classes, etc. 

However, I do not really care at least when it comes to this generator because it will not be part of the website itself, and as to actually coding the website, I will rely on the Laravel magic to do all the awesome behind-the-scene stuff.

Anyway, check it out, lemme know what you think and how I can improve!
